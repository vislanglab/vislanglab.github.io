//NOTES ON CHANGING!

//TO CHANGE THE INSTRUCTION TEXT edit this
	//var instructions = "Welcome back! In this session, you will again see several comic strips like the ones you might see in a newspaper. Your job is to read them and decide whether you had seen these strips in the previous session. For each one, you will answer whether you think that you had seen that same strip before (YES/NO) and how confident you are about your decision (e.g., if you said "No, I did not see the given sequence before", then rate how confident you are that you did not see it). For each response, please press a number on the keyboard as indicated by the screen.Please press the space bar when you're ready."
	// To make it prettier, define it within html

//TO CHANGE THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IN A TRIAL...
	//head down to line 110 where the inner loop template starts

//TO CHANGE THE SOURCE IMAGES ETC
	//var URL_stem = "https://vislanglab.github.io/mns1-2/img/"; //location of the stimuli, URL or...
	var URL_stem = "img/"; //location of the stimuli, relative path to this file

	//Deal with counterbalancing etc and re-configure so that we can use in lab.js template
	//using same datasource arrays as in previous experiments with jspsych
